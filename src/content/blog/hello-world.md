Hello user of the internet! Hope you're doing well. So, I've been thinking a lot, and I've decided to start a blog. It's mainly to keep track of what I'm up to, and hopefully it teaches you something new!

## What to expect

Well nothing too fancy, just stuff about software engineering, cheat sheets for Neovim, the TALL stack, some JS, and arch Linux (I use it BTW)

That's pretty much it. Catch you later, internet buddy!
